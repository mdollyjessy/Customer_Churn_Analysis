# Customer_Churn_Analysis
Telecom Customer Churn analysis Project 
This project focuses on identifying and predicting customer churn using real-world inspired data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses understand why customers leave and proactively retain at-risk customers.

🔍 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge across industries. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones—but only if we can predict churn early. This project aims to:

Analyze key behavioral and demographic factors behind churn
Build a robust predictive model to identify high-risk customers
Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies

🧠 Key Techniques Used
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data cleaning, visualization, outlier detection
2. Feature Engineering: Categorical encoding, handling imbalance with SMOTE
3. Modeling: XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning
4. Evaluation: Classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1), ROC-AUC, confusion matrix
5. Risk Segmentation: Tagging customers into risk groups (High, Medium, Low)

💡 Key Reasons for Customer Churn (Backed by Data)
Short Tenure
🔹 ~65% of churners left within the first 12 months.
New users are more likely to churn—highlighting onboarding issues.

High Monthly Charges
🔹 Avg. charge for churners: $74 vs non-churners: $61
High cost without perceived value drives exits.

No Contract Plans
🔹 85% of churners were on month-to-month plans.
Easy exits lead to higher churn.

Payment by Electronic Check
🔹 2x churn rate vs auto-pay customers.
Possibly linked to lower engagement or trust.

Multiple Add-on Services
🔹 Heavy users of online services (streaming, device protection) showed higher churn—likely due to service dissatisfaction.
